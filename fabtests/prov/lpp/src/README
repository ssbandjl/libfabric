Building
========
Lpp_regression is build as part of tabtests.
Follow the usuall steps to build it:
./configure && make && sudo make install

Running
=======
The libfabric .so file must either be in the system lib path or LD_LIBRARY_PATH
must be set accordingly. To run the basic test, run the following on both test
nodes:

user@node1 $ FI_LPP_MAX_EAGER_SIZE=2048 ./lpp_regression
user@node2 $ FI_LPP_MAX_EAGER_SIZE=2048 ./lpp_regression

If the hosts are not preconfigured in the test code, information about the peer
node must also be specified:

user@node1 $ FI_LPP_MAX_EAGER_SIZE=2048 ./lpp_regression -P node2 -N 0
user@node2 $ FI_LPP_MAX_EAGER_SIZE=2048 ./lpp_regression -P node1 -N 1
